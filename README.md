# Tic Tac Toe
Simple Tic Tac Toe app developed using **Swift**. 
The game allows users to play against a hard-coded AI.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- AI opponent that makes the game difficult to win.
- Classic tic tac toe game with standard rules.

The app was refactored using **MVVM** architecture, as this was my main goal with this project.

In the bottom right area of the view there is a small italic text that keeps track of past scores between user and AI. The data is stored as user default, so it will not reset after the app is closed.
